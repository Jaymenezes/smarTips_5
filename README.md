## Notes

I'm recently took the IOS Codepath for universities. It was an amazing experience and I can tell i eveolved a lot, just by revamping my tip calculator project. I was able to debug and implement lots of functionalities which would be impossible a couple of months ago.
Anyway, I'm really excited about the curriculum in this program, because of its focus on design prototyping. I've dedicated a lot of time and energy to the IOS University program, but cant' help to feel that previous knowledge stops me from being in the top of the class.. I feel that in this program focused on the design aspects of it i can get a lot more out. Thanks in advance.
